## 🎯 Feature Details

### History Screen (`history_screen.dart`)
**Functionality:**
- ✅ Fetches all service requests for current user from `service_requests` table
- ✅ Sorts by `created_at` DESC (newest first)
- ✅ Displays service type, status, and creation date

- ✅ Formatted date display (Bugün, Dün, X gün önce)

**Key Features:**
- Uses `serviceRequestHistoryWithRefreshProvider` for data fetching
- Implements `isRequestRatedProvider` to check rating status
- Turkish language UI throughout
- Clean card-based layout

### Rating Screen (`rating_screen.dart`)
**Functionality:**
- ✅ Accepts requestId as route parameter
- ✅ Interactive 1-5 star rating selector with visual feedback
- ✅ Text field for optional comment (max 500 characters)
- ✅ "Gönder" (Submit) button with loading state
- ✅ Checks if request already rated on load

- ✅ Success feedback with SnackBar
- ✅ Auto-navigation back to history after successful submission
- ✅ Error display with inline error message container
- ✅ Rating text labels (Çok Kötü, Kötü, Orta, İyi, Mükemmel)

**Validation:**
- Ensures star rating is selected (1-5)
- Comment is optional but trimmed if provided
- Disables submit button while loading or if no rating selected

### Rating Repository (`rating_repository.dart`)
**Database Operations:**
- ✅ `submitRating()` - Insert rating into database
  - Handles unique constraint violation (request_id is unique)
  - Proper error messages in Turkish
- ✅ `getRatingForRequest()` - Fetch existing rating
- ✅ `getProviderRatings()` - Get all ratings for a provider
- ✅ `getCustomerRatings()` - Get all ratings by a customer
- ✅ `isRequestRated()` - Check if request has been rated

**Security:**
- Relies on Supabase RLS policies
- Validates customer_id matches auth.uid()
- Ensures request is completed and has provider_id

### Rating Provider (`rating_provider.dart`)
**State Management:**
- ✅ `RatingSubmissionNotifier` - Manages submission state
- ✅ `ratingSubmissionProvider` - Main provider for rating submission
- ✅ `isRequestRatedProvider` - Family provider to check rating status
- ✅ `requestRatingProvider` - Family provider to fetch rating details

**State Structure:**
```dart
class RatingSubmissionState {
  final bool isLoading;
  final String? error;
  final Rating? rating;
}
```

### History Provider (`history_provider.dart`)
**State Management:**
- ✅ `serviceRequestHistoryProvider` - Auto-dispose future provider
- ✅ `refreshHistoryProvider` - State provider for manual refresh trigger
- ✅ `serviceRequestHistoryWithRefreshProvider` - History with refresh capability

**Features:**
- Auto-refresh when returning from rating screen
- Manual refresh via refresh button
- Automatic disposal to prevent memory leaks

## 🔐 Security & Data Access

### RLS Policy Compliance
The implementation follows existing Supabase Row Level Security policies:

**For service_requests:**
- Customers can only read their own requests (customer_id = auth.uid())
- Auto-filtering by customer_id in queries

**For ratings:**
- Customers can create ratings for their completed requests
- Unique constraint on request_id prevents duplicate ratings
- Validates request is completed and has provider_id
- Anyone can view ratings (public display)

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Design Consistency
- ✅ Material 3 design system
- ✅ Consistent color scheme with existing app
- ✅ Turkish language throughout
- ✅ Proper spacing and padding
- ✅ Card-based layouts
- ✅ Icon integration

### User Feedback
- ✅ Loading indicators (CircularProgressIndicator)
- ✅ Error messages via SnackBar (Turkish)
- ✅ Success confirmation messages
- ✅ Empty state messaging
- ✅ Visual rating feedback (amber stars)
- ✅ Status color coding

### Navigation Flow
```
Dashboard → History Screen → Rating Screen → Back to History
    ↓           ↓                 ↓              ↓
  "Geçmiş"   List of      Rate completed    Updated
   Button    Requests       service         status
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### ratings table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.ratings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    request_id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES service_requests(id),
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
    provider_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
    stars INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (stars >= 1 AND stars <= 5),
    comment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Constraints:**
- `request_id` is UNIQUE - prevents duplicate ratings
- `stars` must be between 1 and 5
- All foreign keys with CASCADE delete

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### History Screen
- [ ] Navigate to history from dashboard
- [ ] Verify empty state shows when no requests
- [ ] Create a service request and verify it appears

#### Rating Screen
- [ ] Navigate from completed request in history
- [ ] Test star selection (all 5 stars)
- [ ] Verify rating text updates (Çok Kötü to Mükemmel)
- [ ] Submit rating without comment
- [ ] Submit rating with comment
- [ ] Try to rate same request twice (should show already rated)

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure all migrations are applied to Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. Verify RLS policies are active:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'ratings';
   ```

3. Test with real user accounts in development

### Environment Setup
No additional environment variables needed. Uses existing:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## 📱 User Flow Examples

### Example 1: First-time Rating
1. User completes a service request
2. Navigates to "Geçmiş" from dashboard
3. Sees completed request with "Değerlendir" button
4. Taps button → Rating screen opens
5. Selects 5 stars, adds comment "Harika hizmet!"
6. Taps "Gönder"
7. Success message appears
8. Returns to history → Shows "Değerlendirildi" badge

### Example 2: Viewing History
1. User taps "Geçmiş" on dashboard
2. Sees list of all past requests
3. Each shows service type, status, date
4. Can see which requests are rated
5. Can tap refresh to update list

### Example 3: Attempting Duplicate Rating
1. User tries to rate already-rated request
2. Rating screen immediately shows "Zaten Değerlendirildi"
3. Green checkmark icon displayed
4. "Geri Dön" button to return

## 🔄 State Management Architecture

### Provider Hierarchy
```
authStateProvider
    ↓
currentUserProvider
    ↓
serviceRequestHistoryWithRefreshProvider
    ↓
isRequestRatedProvider (per request)
    ↓
ratingSubmissionProvider
```

### Data Flow
```
UI (History Screen)
    ↓
ref.watch(serviceRequestHistoryWithRefreshProvider)
    ↓
ServiceRequestRepository.getCustomerServiceRequests()
    ↓
Supabase Query (with RLS)
    ↓
List<ServiceRequest> returned
    ↓
UI renders list with cards
```
